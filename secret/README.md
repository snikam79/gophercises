This is my version of https://gophercises.com/exercises/secret
For large portion of code I'm using the original code of https://gophercises.com/exercises/secret For example cipher.go

By going through videos I implemented it. For unit testing there is vault_test.go which tests basic vault functionality. I am stciking to  encryption/decryption described in exercise since I have limited knowldge of cryptography.
